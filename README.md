# How-Does-Aging-Impact-Running
Running success is influenced by a wide variety of factors. These include but are not limited to:

- Training
- Genetics
- Environmental Conditions

A factor that has garnered considerable interest is age. It is believed to affect a runner's speed and endurance, but is this true? And, if it is, to what extent? While studies have previously explored the relationship between age and performance in other sports, running offers unique challenges due to its reliance on both aerobic and anaerobic fitness, which changes over the course of a person's life. In this paper, I aim to find whether age plays a significant role in determining running times. I focus on Olympic distances such as the 1,500m, the 10,000m, and the 100m. I analyze a diverse range of runners within the top 1000 fastest times for their respective event with the goal of providing insight into how age correlates with running performance and whether it is a factor that should be considered when evaluating race results, and, if so, to what extent.
